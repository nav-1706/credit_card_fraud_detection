# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, it demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, and model evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Problem**: Credit card fraud is rare but critical. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions forming less than 0.2% of all data.
- **Goal**: To build an ML model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data processing
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – model building and evaluation

## 📊 Workflow Summary

1. **📦 Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Understand the imbalance in fraud vs legitimate transactions.
   - Visualize transaction amounts and class distribution.

2. **⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling**
   - Applied **under-sampling** to balance legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

3. **🧪 Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained **Logistic Regression** model.
   - Evaluated performance on:
     - **Training Data**
     - **Test Data**

4. **📈 Metrics Used**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision/Recall (recommended for future enhancements)

## ✅ Results

- Built a robust model with significant accuracy on both training and test datasets.
- Effectively addressed class imbalance using under-sampling strategy.
- Gained insights into fraud patterns using data visualizations.
